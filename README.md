## How to Play

### Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed

- **Enter**: Confirm selections in menus
- **1-4**: Select menu options
- **ESC**: Return to previous menu

### Gameplay
1. Control the snake (@) to eat food (#)
2. Each food eaten increases score by 10 points

- Enter your name when achieving a high score
- Names must be alphanumeric characters only (letters and numbers)
- Maximum 20 characters, automatically converted to uppercase
- View all high scores organized by difficulty level

## File Structure

- `snake_game.py` - Main game file
- `leaderboard.json` - High scores storage (created automatically)
- `README.md` - This documentation

## Technical Notes

- Uses Python's `curses` library for terminal UI
- Non-blocking input for smooth gameplay
- JSON-based persistent storage for high scores
- Input validation with regex patterns
- Proper resource cleanup and error handling

## Development

### Git Workflow
